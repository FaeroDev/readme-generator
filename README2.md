  <!-- ## Result
  
  I created an html file with basic layout. I then created a javascript file with logic to call apis to get weather data for entered cities. The searched cities were saved to local storaage, which was used to create an array to create functioning history search buttons. The api weather data was used to fill dynamically created containers. All criteria were met. See below screenshots for final product and code.
